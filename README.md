## Dataset:
* This project deals with the lendingClub dataset with some additional features to give better insights.
* LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
## Goal:
* Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we want to build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan.
* The "loan_status" column contains our label or it is the dependent variable(predicting class).

## Steps Performed:
* First, we perform exploratory Data Analysis using Python's NumPy,pandas,Seaborn and Matplotlib modules.
* Second, we perform Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering to remove any features which do not impact our goal prediction. 
* Third, we perform model building. It involves building a Neural Network using Keras for Loan Repayment Prediction.
* We achieve an accuracy of 89%.
* Finally,we have included Tensorboard with jupyter notebook.
