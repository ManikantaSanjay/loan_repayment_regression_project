# ml_mini_project2
## Description:
* This project was created as part of my Udemy course "Data Science And Machine Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla.
* This project is one of the many to-do projects as an exercise for understanding the concepts practically.
* This project deals with the lendingClub dataset with some additional features.
* It involves exploratory Data Analysis using Python's NumPy,pandas,Seaborn and Matplotlib modules.
* It involves data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Then it deals with building a neural network using Keras for loan repayment prediction.
* Later,I have modified the notebook to include Tensorboard with jupyter notebook.
* TensorBoard is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding the TensorFlow runs and graphs.
