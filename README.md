# Hello there, fintech enthusiasts! 👋💰

Welcome to **Loan Repayment Regression Project**. This project uses Sequential Neural Networks to predict loan repayment.

## What's it all about? 🤔

This project deals with the LendingClub dataset with some additional features to give better insights. LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

The goal is to build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan based on historical data on loans given out and information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off). The "loan_status" column contains the label; it is the dependent variable (predicting class).

## How does it work? 🛠️

### Steps Performed:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - We perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Python's NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib modules.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering** - We perform Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering to remove features which do not impact our goal prediction.

3. **Model Building and Training** - We perform Model Building and Training. It involves building a Sequential Neural Network using Keras for Loan Repayment Prediction. Early Stopping mechanism has been employed.

4. **Evaluation of Model Performance** - We perform Evaluation of Model Performance using classification report and confusion matrix.

## Outcome 🎯

We achieve an accuracy of 89%. Finally, we have configured Tensorboard with Jupyter notebook to view the essential model graphs for model evaluation and the workflow.
